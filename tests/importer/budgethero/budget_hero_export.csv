It would be interesting to add the ability to offering tax breaks and other incentives to corporations who return manufacturing to the U.S. and invest in cleaner, more efficient production processes (beyond ""cap-n-trade"").  I was also surprised that under ""Infrastructure"" there was no option for the Fed to spend on upgrading our national highways, high-speed and freight rail, bridges and ports, power transmission, communications networks and other public works projects. Such measures could provide much needed jobs to middle-class skilled workers, increase technical know-how and efficiencies, improve safety and the well-being of all citizens. Investing in the Commons which would mutually benefit all.  And, even if it doesn't belong in a budget exercise, passing a constitutional amendment ending 'corporate personhood' would do wonders in ending the current oligarchic state of the nation where the top 2 percent control the politics and the direction of the country."

I am worried that certain upstart politicians will cut their noses off to spite their faces. They will dig their heels in for the sake of their own ego instead of what is good for the whole. Promote the general welfare.  Is that not what the Constitution says?  Why then when someone tries to do something good for others is it called communism or socialism?  These fear factors are used to scare people into not voting for a more just and fair society.  Lending a helping hand is taboo.  They ought to play this game.   Better yet we ought to make a Peace Corp term manditory for politicians before they run for office.        I am sorry but I just cannot in good conscience see little old ladies and men, disabled people, and mothers who work but need some help because they have children,  be thrown to the wolves.  I cannot see someone dying because they have no healthcare.  That is not the right thing to do or to allow to happen.    This is not the America I envision.  I am not a communist or a socialist.  I just know the difference between right and wrong, and I have empathy.  To think that some politicians would crush the needy,  but at the same time allow super rich people tax breaks on corporate jets is sickening.        The major corporations' CEOs are making huge salaries even during this recession.  Instead they blame unions, taxes, regulations and healthcare costs for sending most of our manufacturing jobs overseas.  That is not true.  It is their greed and need to feel powerful (money means power) that makes them look for a cheaper way to produce goods.  The American market was not big enough.  They wanted more money.  So they sold this whole globalization idea to the public.  They sold it under the guise that countries like China and others would benefit.  Instead it was more like ""Wow a billion people! I'd like to sell something over there!""  Then it became lets make it there too!!!  We can exploit the lack of labor laws, safety laws, unions and cheaper standards of living.  We can put more money into our pockets!!!   However, it all came at the expense of our own country.  They think and believe they are so rich it will never affect them or their children.   They feel cushioned from the realities of the struggling middle class and lower class.  They are right.  There will be generations living off the money they made by crushing the average worker.         Why do these CEOs not care to look at the general ledgers for their companies?  Instead of bonuses of 40 million, why not 20 million?  Why not put the other half into their workers hands?  How many filet mingions or lobsters can they eat?  How many homes or cars do they need to own?  What could you do with 40 million that you could not do with 20 million?   I think we are finally seeing super predators in politics.  Super preditors from what I read years ago are people who are growing up without moral values.  The growth of this population has been on the rise since society's values have dropped.  They lack empathy.  They are egocentric.  Sometimes they cannot tell the difference between right and wrong.  They are sociopaths.  To think sociopaths are in our government is really frightening!"
