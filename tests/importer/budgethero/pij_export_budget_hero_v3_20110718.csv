It would be interesting to add the ability to offering tax breaks and other incentives to corporations who return manufacturing to the U.S. and invest in cleaner, more efficient production processes (beyond ""cap-n-trade"").  I was also surprised that under ""Infrastructure"" there was no option for the Fed to spend on upgrading our national highways, high-speed and freight rail, bridges and ports, power transmission, communications networks and other public works projects. Such measures could provide much needed jobs to middle-class skilled workers, increase technical know-how and efficiencies, improve safety and the well-being of all citizens. Investing in the Commons which would mutually benefit all.  And, even if it doesn't belong in a budget exercise, passing a constitutional amendment ending 'corporate personhood' would do wonders in ending the current oligarchic state of the nation where the top 2 percent control the politics and the direction of the country."
